<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Item Revisions aims to enhance all items in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II. Weak items have been made more effective, overpowered items have been toned down, and many item descriptions have been extended or replaced with more interesting descriptions. Item Revisions additionally includes a number of rule changes that may be installed individually, according to your preferences.</p>
</div>
<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>If we discover bugs in the current version of the mod, we correct them in a hotfix package. Before installing <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>, check <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=15698">here</a> to see if a hotfix package has been released.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>General Compatibility</strong><br />
    This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal">BG2:ToB</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>, Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BG:EE</acronym>, and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BGII:EE</acronym>. Item Revisions should work well with most other <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and non-<acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mods if a proper install order is followed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main component of <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> overwrites existing items and their descriptions, so it should be installed before mods that patch items. If you would prefer certain items remain unaltered by <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>, you have the option to disable specific item modifications prior to installing the mod. You can find instructions on how to do this in the Power Users section below.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other components of <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> have been designed to patch all items, including items added by other mods, so they should be installed after all mods that add or replace items. Ideally, these components should be installed just after other tweak mods (near the very end of the install).
  </p>
  <p>
    The WeiDU installer used by <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> allows you to install just the main component, quit the installation, install other mods, and then restart the <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> installer to install the remaining <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> components.
  </p>
  <p><strong>One Pixel Productions v4</strong><br />
    Erephine has kindly granted permission to use some of her beautiful <acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym> artwork in the main component of <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>.  Our items have customized colourings to match changes to item abilities and lore.
  </p>
  <p>Included <acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym> Components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Core Paperdolls</li>
    <li>Core Content Patches</li>

    <li>GUI Additions for BGII</li>
    <li>Avatar Fixes</li>
    <li>Female Dwarves</li>

    <li>Softer Spell Effects</li>
    <li>Consistent Spell and Scroll Icons</li>
    <li>Spell Tweaks</li>

    <li>Fixed Animations for Solars and Elementals</li>
    <li>Miscellaneous Content Fixes</li>
    <li>Improved Projectile Effects - if installed before <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>'s main component</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Incompatible <acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym> Components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Core Updates and Item Patches - partially included; can be installed before <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>'s main component but will be mostly overwritten</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>D0Tweak</strong><br />
    The Visual Ioun Stones component from Ding0's Tweak Pack should not be installed together with <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>'s main component because <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> includes WoRm's ioun stone animations instead.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mod Components that Overwrite Item Descriptions</strong><br />
    Some old tweak mods overwrite existing item descriptions. If you use mods like <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> that change item descriptions, avoiding these components will help to ensure your descriptions remain accurate.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ashes of Embers: Sensible weapon restrictions</li>
    <li>Ashes of Embers: Throwing Spears</li>
    <li>Unfinished Business: Extended ToB Item Descriptions - included in <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>'s main component</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong>
    <br />Item Revisions is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. This method is not recommended when you wish to apply hotfixes, unless you quit from the WeiDU installer when it appears.
  </p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should have an item_rev folder and setup-item_rev.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. To install, simply double-click setup-item_rev.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run <strong>setup-item_rev.exe</strong> in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong>
    <br /><em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version.</em> Item Revisions is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. If properly extracted, you should have an item_rev folder, setup-item_rev, and setup-item_rev.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-item_rev.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong>
    <br />Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
    <br /><br />Run <strong>WeInstall item_rev</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p><strong>How to Prevent Certain Items from Being Installed</strong>
    <br />Note: this must be done before installing the mod. To disable a certain item, open the file <strong>item_rev/components/main_component.tpa</strong> with a text editor, search for the item in question and comment it out /* like so */. Anything inside the commented area will get skipped when installing. Here is an example for Carsomyr.
    <br /><br />main_component.tpa - searching for 'Carsomyr' yields:
    <br /><em>// Carsomyr +4
    <br />COPY ~item_rev\itm\sw2h10.itm~      ~override\sw2h10.itm~
    <br />SAY NAME1 @1760
    <br />SAY NAME2 @2199
    <br />SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC @1762
    <br />SAY DESC @2200</em>
    <br /><br />Adding the following will prevent the item from being installed:
    <br /><em>// Carsomyr +4
    <br /><span class="red">/* </span>COPY ~item_rev\itm\sw2h10.itm~      ~override\sw2h10.itm~
    <br />SAY NAME1 @1760
    <br />SAY NAME2 @2199
    <br />SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC @1762
    <br />SAY DESC @2200<span class="red"> */</span></em>
    <br /><br />Congratulations, Carsomyr +4 will no longer be changed when you install the mod! But wait, doesn't Carsomyr have an upgrade in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>? To prevent that from being installed, you'd need to keep searching for Carsomyr and comment out the +5 version when you find it, too. If you have any questions or require assistance with any of the above, feel free to drop us a line in the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">forum</a>.

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The changes made by Item Revisions fall into two categories - individual and global. The main component of the mod will install all of the individual changes, like adding new abilities and lore to existing items. The other components of the mod are designed to provide rule changes to all items in the game, including those added by other mods.</p>
  <h3>Main Component</h3>
  <p><strong>Item Revisions by Demivrgvs</strong>
    <br /><em>Any modifications made to items prior to installing this component will be overwritten.</em>
    <br /><br />This component contains all of the changes made to specific items, and as of V4 it also automatically includes the executable patch ToBEx (the engine modification is needed for several changes to function properly). For full details on each item check the online <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=15700">Item Index</a>.
    <br /><strong>This component has been designed in tandem with other optional components, and may not be balanced without them installed. Components that are deemed critical for balance when installing the main component will carry a red asterisk (<span class="red">*</span>). In cases where a component has multiple options, a blue asterisk (<span class="blue">*</span>) will be used for recommended options.</strong>
    <br /><br />Listed below are some of the philosophical changes.
    <ul>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Characteristics Set by Items</strong>
        <br />Items that previously set character attributes to X now increase the base value by Y. This change is aimed to remove some exploits (like having characters with 3 charisma suddenly becoming more charismatic than King Arthur just by equipping a standard magic item), and to make characters' starting attributes more important.
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>Items that previously set characteristics to 18 or 19 will now grant +2 instead, 20 to 21 are now +3, 22 to 23 are +4, and 24 to 25 become +5. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Sensible Prices</strong>
        <br />I found the prices of items in vanilla <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> to often be quite random, and I wanted to tie them to the actual value of the item. I've used the following table as a guideline to standardize item prices, adjusting it a little when needed.
        <br />
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th class="leftalign">Total Enhancement Bonus</th>
            <th>Price</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">Base Item</td>
            <td>As Per <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym> 2nd Edition Player's Handbook</td>
            <td>&nbsp;
          </td></tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">Masterwork</td>
            <td>500gp</td>
            <td>Daggers: Only 250gp</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+1</td>
            <td>1000gp</td>
            <td>Regular Full Plate Is Treated as +1 Quality</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+2</td>
            <td>3000gp</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+3</td>
            <td>5000gp</td>
            <td>Stonefire as a +2 Axe with the Flaming Property Is Treated as +3 Quality</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+4</td>
            <td>7500gp</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+5</td>
            <td>10000gp</td>
            <td>And So On...</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sensible prices combined with Store Revisions will make money a real issue. Think twice before buying every cool thing you see.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Sensible Lore System</strong>
        <br />In my opinion, the lore system in the vanilla game was broken, having random lore values and allowing a level 10 bard to identify just about everything. I've changed both the lore table and the required lore to identify every item. The effect of intelligence and wisdom on lore is unchanged.
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>Lore Table: Fighters/Paladins/Rangers (+1 lore/level), Clerics/Druids (+2 lore/level), Thieves/Blades (+3 lore/level), Mages (+4 lore/level), Bards (+6 lore/level). </li>
          <li>Lore Required to Identify: Every item will require 10 lore per enchantment bonus, plus an additional 5, 10, or 15, depending on whether the item is common, rare, or unique. For example, Arrows +1 have a +1 bonus and are quite common, thus they will require 15 lore to be identified. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Store Revisions</h3>
  <p>The structure of this component may be a subject to change in future versions, with possibility of splitting it into several components. Full documentation of changes is pending.
  <br /><br />Due to the nature of this component, it is conceptually incompatible with mods that add new items into vanilla stores. Nothing drastic will happen, though - you simply may discover that a merchant, who was supposed to sell scrolls, now also offers a sword, even if there is a blacksmith standing nearby.
  <br /><br />At the moment this component is only fully compatible with Spell Revisions (main component), aTweaks (Expanded Temple Services component) and Rogue Rebalancing (Additional equipment for Thieves and Bards component) if installed after them.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Store Revisions (<span class="red">*</span>)</strong>
  <br />Changes made by this component can be grouped into the following categories.
    <ul>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Revised assortiment in stores</strong>
        <br />Each shop offers more unique selection of goods, than they generally did in vanilla BG2. Some also have their price mark-up changed.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Re-allocation of lootable items</strong>
        <br />Some items, potions and scrolls are moved between crates, enemies and stores. Some powerful items have been sensibly removed from stores and are now effectively used by enemies, others have been moved to more appropriate locations based on their background. A number of ToB items are made available during the late stage of SoA.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Re-ordering of items by their type in stores</strong>
        <br />Items will be ordered by their type and, to certain extent, enchantment level.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Revised temple services</strong>
        <br />Temples will offer spells (and items in some cases) more suitable to their deities.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>More scrolls with divine spells</strong>
	    <br />A wider selection of divine spells may be cast from scrolls.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Effect of Charisma and Reputation on Store Prices</strong>
	        <br />Reputation will no longer provide any discount (most stores shouldn't even know charname's reputation, and it doesn't make sense that neutral or evil parties are so heavily penalized). Charisma will still give a small discount.
	        <br /><br />
	        <ul>
	          <li>
	            <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 15/16 (-5%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 17/18 (-10%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 19/20 (-15%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 21/22 (-20%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 23/24 (-25%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 25 (-30%).
	          </li>
	        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>


  <h3>Global Changes </h3>
  <p>These components are designed to affect all items in game, and should be installed after other mods that add items.</p>

  <p><strong>Revised Armors (<span class="red">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />This component aims at making each armor type appealing in its own way: light armors allow high mobility while heavier armors offer higher protection in exchange for reduced mobility.
    <br /><br /><em>Note: This is one of the components that relies on a user-submitted list to categorize armors into their proper type. If you find an item that appears unaffected by this change, or miscategorized, please submit a report <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">here</a> and include whether you have installed the main <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> component or not.</em>
  <ul>
  <p><strong>With Movement Speed Penalties (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />This option applies a reduction to movement speed, dexterity and speed factor while adding a small amount of damage resistance while wearing armor. The following table elaborates on the penalties and damage resistance.
  </p>
  <table>

      <th class="leftalign">Armor</th>

  <p><strong>Without Movement Speed Penalties (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />This option applies all the above changes except the reduction to movement speed.
  </p>
  </ul>

    <p><strong>Revised Armor Bonuses (<span class="red">*</span>)</strong>
      <br />As of V4 this component is an integral part of the above Revised Armors. This component changes the hidden <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> bonuses vs different weapon types.

  <p><strong>With Casting Speed Penalties for Arcane Casters (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />With this option, spells cast while wearing armor take longer to complete. The casting time penalty depends on the type of armor worn. Spells with longer casting times are easier for enemies to interrupt. A casting time of 10 is equivalent to a full round. Due to engine limitations, innate abilities and divine spells cast by arcane casters while wearing armor will also be affected by this change.</strong>

Daggers, short swords, wakizashis, ninja-tos, clubs and handaxes are considered light and give a +1 bonus to off-hand <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym>. Bastard swords, flails, katanas and battleaxes are considered heavy and give a -1 penalty to off-hand <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym>. All other melee weapons are classified as medium and have no bonuses or penalties. The table below summarizes the main hand/off-hand <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> results.

  <p><strong>Revised Backstabbing (<span class="red">*</span>)</strong>
  <br /><em>This component is conceptually incompatible with the Improved Backstabbing component from Ding0's Tweak Pack (d0tweak).</em>
  <br /><br />
  <ul>
  <p><strong>Thief-only Weapons</strong>
  <br />This option applies a penalty to backstabbing with certain weapon types as listed below. It does not enable backstabbing with weapons that single-class thieves cannot normally use - everything on the table at a -2 or worse modifier with the exception of quarterstaffs will remain unsuitable for backstabbing.
  </p>

  <p><strong>More Weapons Usable for Backstabbing (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />This optiont applies a penalty to backstabbing with certain weapon types as listed above. It also enables the use of backstabbing with weapons traditionally unsuitable for backstabbing.
  </p>
  <p><strong>All Melee and Ranged Weapons Usable For Backstabbing (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />This optiont applies a penalty to backstabbing with certain weapon types as listed above. It also enables the use of backstabbing with any weapon, including ranged ones.
  </p>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Revised Critical Hit Aversion (<span class="red">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />This component will remove "immunity to critical hits" feature from all head slot items, making criticals something players should fear again (right now the whole party is immune to it because even Ioun Stones protect from them), and allowing the Main Component to use "immunity to critical hits" as a valuable special feature of selected items (e.g. a fortified armor). In exchange for losing the protection from critical hits, helmets will get 1 point of AC bonus. Circlets, ioun stones, and similar items won't get this AC bonus.
    <br /><br /><em>Note: If you find an item that appears unaffected by this change, please submit a report <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">here</a>.</em>
  </p>

    <p><strong>Items of Protection Can Be Worn with Magical Armor (<span class="red">*</span>)</strong>
      <br />This allows one to equip Necklaces, Rings, and Cloaks of Protection alongside magical armor, but it does not allow more than one item of Protection to be worn at the same time.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Remove Cleric Weapon Restrictions from Multi-Classed Clerics</strong>
      <br />Fighter/clerics with swords? Yes.
    </p>

    <p><strong>PnP Equipment for Druids (<span class="red">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />According to PnP, druids shun metal, but instead may wear equipment made from natural sources (namely scales of beasts). Items include armor, shields and headgear.
    <br /><br /><em>Note: This is one of the components that relies on a user-submitted list of items. If you find an item that appears unaffected by this change, please submit a report <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">here</a>.</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p><strong>Druids only (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
        <br />This option affects only single-class druids.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Druids and Fighter/Druids (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
        <br />This option affects both single-class druids and their fighter multiclass.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Kensai Can Wear Bracers (<span class="red">*</span>)</strong>
      <br />This component allows the kensai kit to wear bracers.
      <br /><br /><em>Note: This is one of the components that relies on a user-submitted list of bracers. If you find an item that appears unaffected by this change, please submit a report <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">here</a>.</em>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Thieves Can Use Wands (<span class="red">*</span>)</strong>
      <br />Thieves can use magic wands, as long as they meet the intelligence requirement.
      <br /><br /><em>Note: This is one of the components that relies on a user-submitted list of wands. If you find an item that appears unaffected by this change, please submit a report <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">here</a>.</em>

<h2>Shout Outs</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Demi:</strong> Firstly, many thanks to Gibberlings Three, especially Cam, and cmorgan!
    <br />Huge thanks of course to Westley Weimer, who created an astonishingly flexible and powerful mod editor for <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games, and to the bigg for his modifications to that editor. Many thanks also to the creators of the Infinity Engine Structure Description Project, which clarified what the hell was going on several dozen times; and to Jon Hauglid, for Near Infinity.
    <br />Special thanks to Erephine for creating and letting me use that wonderful <acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym> material!
    <br />I'm also very grateful to anyone who has beta-tested the mod and/or provided much useful feedback.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> I'd like to give a big thanks to the authors of the many tools used in creation of this mod - we (literally) couldn't have done it without you. The mod community as a whole also deserves special mention - I find the vast majority of those with an interest in the creation and playing of <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> mods are extremely supportive of one another, and knowing that your work will provide enjoyment to others is a great motivator. Finally, I'd like to thank those individuals at <acronym title="The Gibberlings 3">G3</acronym> who set me along the path to modding in the first place, everyone who has expressed interest in the creation of this mod, and <acronym title="The Gibberlings 3">G3</acronym> in general for hosting this here.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2tweaks/index.php"><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweak Pack</a> was a major inspiration and help while coding this mod, and some code has been directly pillaged from it. A couple of the components in <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> are direct imitations of components found in the Tweak Pack or <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/scs/">Sword Coast Stratagems</a>. Animations for ioun stones were created by <a href="http://forums.blackwyrmlair.net/index.php?showforum=83">WoRm</a>.</p>
  <p>Also special thanks to Ascension64 and Taimon for their EXE patches.</p>
