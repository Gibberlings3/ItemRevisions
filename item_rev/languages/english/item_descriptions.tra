The original design may have originated in the earliest of arcane guilds, but the current makers of these items are varied and widespread. Unfortunately multiple protective enchantments of these kind don't stack, and thus no other amulet, cloak, or ring of protection can be worn while wearing this amulet.

Known for its ability to enhance spellcasting, the Amulet of Metaspell Influence is highly sought after by practitioners of magic. It was created by Elairdrin Mellwith who resided in the Star Mountains. His reasons for fabricating such an item stemmed from his womanizing habits, and to this end the Amplifier served his purpose well. It was later taken from him by a wizardress with a more destructive intent, but records detailing the change of hands vary widely.

@1009 = ~Creatures that attack the mind are the stuff of nightmares, so it is not surprising that items protecting against them might acquire some of their disrepute. Greenstone amulets, for example, have been linked to a claim that when the drow first retreated underground they fed on intellect devourers, and that eating such a creature without wearing a greenstone amulet produced a mind flayer. This is all, of course, nothing more than superstitious tavern talk. Nonetheless these mind shielding amulets are indeed used by drows who have to deal with the illithids, as they call them, being it a peaceful deal, or a not so peaceful one.

These highly prized items are fist-sized green stone worked into some kind of smooth shape, usually like a flattened egg, but sometimes like a shield or helmet. When worn, the greenstone protects the wearer from all forms of mind attacks, including psionics.

Years later she returned, a haunted look in her eyes. Around her neck she wore an amulet that glowed with power - only the first of the artifacts she claimed to have learned how to create. She spoke long and passionately of how they could make use of such items - to not only bring peace to Rashemen, but break the back of Thay. The hathrans narrowed their eyes behind their masks as she spoke, fearing the young woman's intensity: but they listened, and gravely made her one of them.

Before long, the witches began to regret their decision. The young woman seemed obsessed with the idea of creating more items of greater and more sinister properties... and her plans grew more and more elaborate, from freeing the slaves of Thay to enslaving the Red Wizards in their place, sapping them of their power for her own devices. It was suspected that Arduelth had become a durthan, eternal enemy of the hathrans - but another witch saw once that she communed with something far darker. Though the young woman still dreamed of peace and freedom for her people, she had given herself over to a dark entity - her pure intentions savaged by the lengths she would dare go to achieve them.

Though it seems Arduelth's life has come to an end, the amulet still glows with a same promising light...

@1027 = ~Shamans of many barbarian clans have long looked upon the cheetah as one of the most nimble and swift hunters. Warriors of these clans rely on agility and quick movements instead of pure strength and they get across the battlefield like a whirlwind. Barbarian shamans would sometimes create spells that would temporarily imbue the warriors with inhuman quickness and fleetness of foot. However, since these spells were temporary, often times the spell would wear off at inopportune times.

Thus a group of barbarian shamans once congregated to find a way to better harness the swift agility of the cheetah. For nearly a year the shamans remained out of sight from their home clans, busily focusing their attentions towards the magic to create such items. Then one day, the shamans returned to their respective clans, each holding a small necklace, with a pendant that resembled a cheetah's paw. The shamans gave this pendant to their strongest warrior of each clan. Once placed around the neck of the warrior, the speed of the cheetah filled their powerful bodies. From then on, the Amulet of Cheetah Speed, as it became known, would become one of the most prized artifacts within barbarian clans. Only the mightiest warriors wore the amulet, and it became the goal of all young warriors to one day be adorned with an amulet such as this.

Unfortunately, she didn't anticipate the Night King's Faithful Hound, who was summoned to guard the room. The phantom watchdog immediately commenced a loud barking, revealing her presence to the Night King himself. When he was finished with her, he took the amulet, and since it had qualities useful for many adventurers, he made copies of it, which he sold throughout the land.

Sickened by his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench which overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates, especially considering a detect magic spell reveals the axe has no magical properties. After a lengthy career of mage slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards.

Under the orders of his commander, Halvan the Dark, he forged ahead through elven forests despite protests and repeated attacks.

It took Denell thirty years to complete his task. When he finished, he was an accomplished warrior, weathered and beaten by years on foreign roads. On his way back to his home, he passed by Harrowdale and saw a wooden statue of Halvan the Dark raised proudly in a small town square. With a single-handed blow, he lodged his huge axe into Halvan's forehead.

Magical battle axes are normally crafted by dwarves to help defend their warriors against their harsher neighbors. This magical axe has seen many battles, but its enchantments and craftsmanship make it a very capable weapon still.

The famous barbarian explorer Graena was a member of the Sky Pony tribe of the Uthgardt northerners. When she tried to leave the tribe to seek her fortune in southern lands, the elders of the tribe told her she could not leave. At that time, only men were allowed to leave the tribe. The elders believed women were too valuable to let go. In order to prove herself to the elders, Graena had to run a gauntlet of the strongest warriors in the tribe and wrest the belt of the head warrior from his body. Graena underwent the challenge and emerged bloody and broken, but victorious. According to tribal law, she was now the head warrior of the tribe and effectively male. The elders knew she was going to leave, but they gave her a warrior's name, Graena Blood-Has-Dried. She left the tribe, relinquished her position to the old head warrior, and returned his belt to him. But before she left, she swore to never harm a member of the tribe if she encountered one in the future.

Years later, she looked back on that fateful day and felt pride in the fact that she had beaten the greatest men of her tribe. She had a girdle constructed that looked identical to the one she had won. Not content to stop there, she had a priest of Tempus bless it with a powerful enchantment. Graena was wearing her belt when she died fighting a group of fire giants near the Marching Mountains.

@1126 = ~This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. Although civilized areas were affected considerably, the true victims were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those who remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land, taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed upon the item its ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

Lord de'Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiates when assembled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity with magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

Completely immune to any and all weapons used against him, Nysrogh rampaged throughout Amn, and Unileth took it upon herself to end the threat she had unleashed. Using her knowledge of the demon's weaknesses, she constructed a great club to defeat Nysrogh, and gave it to a brave but anonymous knight to be her champion.
Unileth's champion issued a challenge to Nysrogh, which the demon readily accepted, confident it could not be harmed by any weaponry known to the Realms. On the field of battle they met and beneath the fierce gaze of Nysrogh, Unileth's champion promptly dropped his weapon and fled in terror.
Nysrogh reached out to claim the champion's discarded club as a symbol of his victory. But as the demon's clawed hand touched the surface of the club he was encircled by a spell of imprisonment, for which he was completely unprepared. Unileth's ploy had worked, and the demon that could not be harmed by any weapon was forever trapped inside the magic club.

The crude wooden club still burns with the raging spirit of the demon forever trapped within by the powerful enchantments placed on the weapon. Occasionally, however, the demon's wrath manages to escape in a fiery blast.

@1159 = ~Amnish fable tells the tale of Nysrogh, a powerful denizen of the lower planes unleashed upon Amn by a careless sorceress named Unileth.
Completely immune to any and all weapons used against him, Nysrogh rampaged throughout Amn, and Unileth took it upon herself to end the threat she had unleashed. Using her knowledge of the demon's weaknesses, she constructed a great club to defeat Nysrogh, and gave it to a brave but anonymous knight to be her champion.
Unileth's champion issued a challenge to Nysrogh, which the demon readily accepted, confident it could not be harmed by any weaponry known to the Realms. On the field of battle they met and beneath the fierce gaze of Nysrogh, Unileth's champion promptly dropped his weapon and fled in terror.
Nysrogh reached out to claim the champion's discarded club as a symbol of his victory. But as the demon's clawed hand touched the surface of the club he was encircled by a spell of imprisonment, for which he was completely unprepared. Unileth's ploy had worked, and the demon that could not be harmed by any weapon was forever trapped inside the magic club.

The enchantments from the Ring of Fire Resistance makes the demon spirit trapped within this weapon easier to control, though the wrath of the creature may occasionally still be released without warning.

Driven by years of rivalry, the Dukes of Spandeliyon and Delthuntle decided to organize a private contest that would proclaim the better archer between them.

He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest he couldn't help gloating about his advantage. The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed. Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself. The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment Edwall's head did much the same.

Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily . . . nay, VERY happily ever after!

@1234 = ~Legends say that craftsman Pinn O'Reffen fashioned this bow from the heart of a Treant, though how he came to possess such material is unknown. He certainly did not anticipate the enchantment within, magic that makes the archer's aim almost infallible, and the arrows it fires strike directly at the target's heart (if it has one), potentially slaying the victim instantly. Pinn claimed his skill was responsible, but it is more likely that some aspect of the soul of the Treant is still within the wood.

Note: certain creatures (such as elementals, golems, and undead) do not have hearts, and are not affected by this weapon's ability.

Bearpaw could draw back the bowstring without the slightest effort, but when he died it was bequeathed to his wife and sons, and not a one could draw the string even halfway. They eventually sold it to a merchant heading south.

@1314 = ~Bands of the Master
When the last kensai of Kamjin-Doh, the Master of Razors, was slain in the fields of western Kara-Tur, these simple leather bands were ripped from his arms... and his arms ripped from his shoulders... as punishment for his destruction of the Kamjin-Doh. The identities of those who defeated him are not known, but the rumors in Kara Tur were that his slayers were the spirits of three sword saints of Kamjin-Doh, returned from death to end the crimes of the renegade kensai.

In the surviving teachings of the Kamjin-Doh of Kara-Tur, it is written that a true weapon master relies not on leather, chain, or plate, but on honing their skills so that they are never struck at all... and this means a weapon master must know their enemy's movements like the movements of their own hand. But such mastery lies in staying focused upon your enemy even in the heat of battle... and these simple leather armbands are intended to do just that. While worn, they exert a slight calming influence on the mind of the sword saint that wields them, heightening the warrior's perceptions and senses, and allowing them to read the movements of their opponents easier. On the rare occasion when an enemy strikes a sword saint, these bands allow the wielder to shrug off pain (which in the teachings of Kamjin-Doh are called "distractions") and keep the pain where it belongs - on one's opponent.

If you wear these bands, never forget their purpose, never forget your focus, and never forget the reach of your enemy. Keep these three things in your heart, and they will serve you well in battle.

He was so annoyed by the inability of his crew to constantly maintain a perfect temperature around him that he hunted down a Stormlord of Talos and slew him for his cloak.
Though Balhoderie had some of his lady friends sew over the Talosian symbols on the cloak with bits of pirate flags, the brothers of the Stormlord never forgot Balhoderie's blasphemous plunder. By 1360, they had managed to install a youthful Stormlord on one of Balhoderie's three ships, the Sarketa. When the opportunity presented itself, the Stormlord roused the crew to mutiny. After Balhoderie had been overthrown, the Stormlord retrieves the cloak and installed himself as the new commander of the dead pirate's fleet.
The Black Cloud Madion terrorized the southern Sword Coast for the next five years before he died in a bloody battle with heavily armed merchant ships just outside the port of Baldur's Gate.

The royal guard of King Pyronan, ruler of Impiltur, were given cloaks such as this as an honorary show of status. Unfortunately, members of the guard had trouble coming to a consensus amongst themselves regarding who should receive such cloak. After years of internal hostility, the mantles were lost and the guards were replaced by less greedy individuals.

Cespenar infused this cloak with even more powerful protective enchantments.

@1426 = ~Montolio's Cloak~
@1427 = ~Montolio Debrouchee, better known as "Mooshie", was a ranger of great renown, having dedicated himself to the defense of all living things not evil in nature, and total dedication to the goddess of the forest, Mielikki, at an early age. He served as a ranger for many years, often as a scout for large armies, or working with small groups of rangers or by himself. Montolio was a good friend and a mentor of the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden. He became blinded five years before he met Drizzt while serving with a ranger group known as the Range Watchers, when they encountered and came into battle against a vicious red dragon, which killed three rangers and melted Montolio's face. His face was healed by clerics, but his eyes were beyond repair. Being pitied even by the Range Watchers and thinking his life meaningless, he fell into despair and came to the grove later known as Mooshie's Grove to die there. Instead, he learned to survive by using his other senses to their fullest extent. He befriended the animals and made it a personal goal to keep watch on, and protect the caravans going near the grove from Graul, an orc leader, and his raiding band. Mooshie eventually died of natural causes in his sleep.

When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent, it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold. Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor, who sought to rule.

Perhaps it comes from the outer planes to help the righteous of Faerun defend their home, or perhaps its arrival here is simply an accident. Regardless of its origin, it's unusually effective against creatures from other planes of existence.

The Rune of Clangeddin, the dwarven god of battle and bravery, is now inscribed on the head of this hammer, granting even greater powers to any who wield the weapon.

Prized for its noble origin as much as for its benefits to the wearer, the first of these helms was originally intended to be a simple gift. There was no great crisis at hand, nor dangerous evil to be overthrown; just a wish for a friend to give a gift to another. It could just as easily have been a good book or a bottle of wine, but adventurers are eminently more practical in their gift giving. Subsequently, because of its effectiveness in any situation, countless variants of this helm were created. These helms have seen many great battles since theirs creation, but the simple virtue at theirs core is what has always been remembered.

Then he set sail for Anchorome once more, not to been seen again to this day. His money was well spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.

The jewels allow the wearer to cast a variety of powerful spells and can absorb significant amounts of fire damage.
The few such helms reported to still exist have been traced back to a great cleric of Lathander from Baldur's Gate named Ergelion. Ergelion equipped his companions with these helms to turn back a horde of undead swarming out of the Troll Hills to the north. Though the horde never reached Baldur's Gate, none of that band of adventurers was seen or heard from again.

Subsequentely he easily dispatched all of them entwisting them in a poisonous cloud of ghastly, green vapors, and landing the killing blows with bare hands.

Suits such as this are much sought after, but few smiths are willing to craft them. The necessary materials are rare and dangerous to acquire, and dragons have long memories where their kin are concerned.

It is considered too cumbersome for use in advanced human cultures, but is common among more barbaric humanoids. It offers better protection than normal leather, but can be hard to maintain, often resulting in an offensive odor or shoddy appearance that prevents effective use.~
@1672 = ~This heavy and thick bear hide is all that remains of the fabled Aeger. Several hundred years ago the Aeger, a giant bear, terrorized hundreds of small villages up and down the Sword Coast. The bear was possessed by a seemingly unstoppable fury and it was invulnerable to fire, cold, electricity and acid. Finally the young men and women of several villages banded together, forming a militia almost two hundred people strong. The Aeger was surrounded and finally slain. Less than a dozen villagers survived, and they carved the Aeger's hide amongst themselves. Out of one of the pieces this armor was created.

The hammer's head was forged of Mithral while the handle crafted with adamantite. Upon the hammer's head there are three dwarven symbols edged in diamond dust. On one side is a set of crossed axe's the symbol of Clangeddin the dwarven god of battle. On the other side is an anvil and hammer, the symbol of Moradin the soulforger. Carefully detailed and layed upon both sides is also the symbol of Dumathoin the keeper of secrets.

This weapon was made specifically for Wulfgar by Bruenor Battlehammer, and the strongest of its enchantments only functions while in the young warrior's hands. Anyone else wields Aegis-Fang as a War Hammer +3.

However, this magical specimen is made of mithral, a very rare, silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard. As a result this full plate does not encoumber more than a chain mail and is treated as a medium armor for purposes of movement and other limitations.

This is the personal armor of Bruenor Battlehammer, and never a finer kit have you seen. It is truly a marvel of battlefield craftsmanship.

Methild the bard was loyal to his king and the king's family and so he used the special powers of his magic harp.
As he played he focussed his attention first on the king. As the song played on, the spell of holding upon the king dissipated, and the noble liege slowly crept away. One by one Methild freed his patrons, being careful to keep the witches attention drawn his way. Finally, once all the family was free, the bard could play no longer and the witches saw his treachery.

But try as he might, Orin was never able to learn the fine art of fletching and eventually he would be forced to return to his castle when his arrows ran out. And each time he returned, he would be inundated with the various nobles and merchants and their petty problems which demanded his attention.
If the stories can be believed, Orin was eventually approached by an unscrupulous merchant who offered him a gift in exchange for the title to all the lands Orin ruled over, a quiver that would produce an infinite amount of magical arrows. Orin quickly agreed to the deal, figuring his problems were forever solved.
Of course the merchant quickly established himself as a cruel and insufferable tyrant, and within a month Orin's subjects had deposed their new ruler, dragged Orin from his beloved forest and imprisoned him in his own castle, forcing him to be their lord once more. To insure he never escaped to the woods again Orin's precious quiver was forever hidden away, and mere mention of it became an offense punishable by death.

@1751 = ~Quiver of Plenty +3~
@1752 = ~One often repeated, though never substantiated, legend holds that the quiver was once given as a gift to Duke Orin Gastlecate. Orin cared little for politics and the day to day duties of his fiefdom, and would often vanish for weeks at a time into the thick forests that covered much of his land where he would live the life of a solitary hunter.
But try as he might, Orin was never able to learn the fine art of fletching and eventually he would be forced to return to his castle when his arrows ran out. And each time he returned, he would be inundated with the various nobles and merchants and their petty problems which demanded his attention.
If the stories can be believed, Orin was eventually approached by an unscrupulous merchant who offered him a gift in exchange for the title to all the lands Orin ruled over, a quiver that would produce an infinite amount of magical arrows. Orin quickly agreed to the deal, figuring his problems were forever solved.
Of course the merchant quickly established himself as a cruel and insufferable tyrant, and within a month Orin's subjects had deposed their new ruler, dragged Orin from his beloved forest and imprisoned him in his own castle, forcing him to be their lord once more. To insure he never escaped to the woods again Orin's precious quiver was forever hidden away, and mere mention of it became an offense punishable by death.

Using specimens pulled from the deepest pits of the ocean, the Imaskari spellcasters slowly began to graft these magically-enhanced creatures onto suits of plate mail, weaning them off of salt water and forcing them to rely on magic for nourishment. This technique worked well, allowing the user a far greater resistance to spells than normal... but other magewrights looked upon this creation with a growing fear, worried that a creature that fed on magic might soon grow too hungry and feed upon its masters instead. Because of this, only a few suits of this armor were ever made, and the creatures created by the Imaskari sealed away and forgotten.

The living symbiote feeds itself with low level spells and consumes them in the process, thus making the wearer completely immune to 1st and 2nd level spells.

Even when defeat was certain and all others allied troops ran amok in chaos the small group of deadpan knights continued to follow their commander's orders and fought until the sun set.

Finally the orc fell but Arngor had sustained wounds too vast for any to save him. His blood soaked through the armor he wore, infusing it with his courage and nobility.

When the village was overrun by orcs, the sling disappeared. This outstanding sling is capable of infusing any projectile fired by it with magical energy, though how it does it remains a mystery.

The modifications to the Erinne sling have made significant improvements to its already impressive enchantments. The magical bullets fired from it can now burst upon impact releasing a massive energy blast so forceful that it can potentially disintegrate the target hit.

Note: requires no ammunition, but normal bullets cannot be fired with this sling. Energy Bullets are considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what they can hit.

His horse remained unscathed allowing for their escape, and his body was carried back to the nearest town, where he was resurrected from death.

Shields like this are first mentioned in ancient liturgies of Amaunator, in which the god's champions bear radiant shields against an infestation of undead.

Since that time a number have been lost in battle, and not a few were stolen by foul creatures to prevent their use.
Once a holy artifact used by the elite sect of clerics and holy warriors called Sunmasters, part of the enchantments fled with their god's demise, but it still remain a powerful tool for any adventurer.

@1985 = ~The dwarven clan of Clangeddin were famous for their work in darksteel, a material not to be found anywhere but within the Clangeddin clan homes within the Marching Mountains. In their efforts to find more and more darksteel, the Clangeddin delved ever deeper into the bowels of the earth.
It was on one such expedition that the seven sons of Argeld Heavyhand, the Clangeddin leader, were lost. The only survivor from the ill-fated expedition was Glimred Heavyhand, youngest son of Argeld. The lad returned with tales of drow and illithid and other darker, nameless horrors the like of which had never before been seen.
Desperate as he was to avenge his sons, Argeld could not send more of his people down into the depths of the mountain to face such horrors. Glimred himself, however, could not be dissuaded. To aid Glimred in his quest for vengeance, the dwarven smiths set about constructing the Darksteel Shield, a heavily enchanted shield that provides more protection than most suits of armor.
But Glimred was impatient, his lust for vengeance could not be deferred, and he disappeared into the bowels of the Marching Mountains before the work was completed, never to be seen again. The disappearance and presumed death of his sole surviving son proved too much for Argeld, who died from the grief of a broken heart.
With their leader dead and their hero Glimred gone, the dwarves knew it was only a matter of time before their clan was overrun by their Underdark enemies. Before dispersing across the face of Faerun, the clan sold the shield to the highest bidder - though the dwarven smiths to this day have refused to divulge the mysterious buyer's identity.

@2000 = ~Pergad the Red-Handed was a famous barbarian warrior near Silverymoon in the 11th century, Dale Reckoning. His tribe's battles against hordes of orcs, goblins, and hill giants are legendary throughout the north. Unfortunately for Pergad, the other tribes of the region decided to move south or settle in the cities of the north rather than fight against the seemingly endless waves of foes. Pergad's tribe, the Tribe of Dead Trees, was the last to make a stand. Though Pergad emerged victorious in a series of difficult battles, his tribe dwindled as quickly as the horde grew. At the Battle of Surbrin Shallows in 1014 DR, Pergad's tribe finally came to its end under cruel ogre clubs and giant-hurled rocks. Legend states that when Pergad finally realized that his tribe was doomed, he drove his trusted spear into the Surbrin riverbed, cursing all the goblins who crossed over the water that his people once thrived on. Orcish shamans claim that the spot where his spear penetrated the rock bled for days. A year later, two tribes of goblins were wiped out by a plague that spread among them after they settled in the Surbrin river valley. The spear subsequently disappeared in the river's currents, and was supposedly dragged into the open sea.
The Impaler has a palpable aura of magic that hints at the nature of the weapon and why it has been the bane of several powerful orc chieftains in the past. As one would guess, when a victim is struck, they are very nearly impaled as the massive enchantment does its dirty work.

@2005 = ~Ixil's Nail +4~
@2006 = ~Shortly after the Time of Troubles began the nomadic bandit tribes of the Calimshan desert were united under a single leader; a cruel and brutal giant of a man, the warlord Ixil Xaxsha. From their outposts in the forbidding desert waste, the nomads raided merchant caravans and terrorized travelers who dared journey over the road from Calimport to Myratma.
Rumors and legends quickly spread about the invincible Ixil, who rode at the head of every raiding party brandishing his infamous magical spear. Some believe he was not truly a man, but a demon in human form, drawn to Faerun by the chaos and confusion of the Time of Troubles.
Ixil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear. Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear, seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.
The warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.

Though Ixil's body was never found, Ixil's Spike, his fearsome spear and the symbol of his power, was recovered. In an effort to utterly destroy the artifact, it was shattered into several pieces, which were scattered about the Southlands. For many generations this magical shaft has been separated from Ixil's Spike, the enchanted head of the legendary spear. However, even incomplete, this artifact is still a weapon of great power.

Ixil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear. Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear, seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.
The warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.

Though Ixil's body was never found, Ixil's Spike, his fearsome spear and the symbol of his power, was recovered. In an effort to utterly destroy the artifact, it was shattered into several pieces, which were scattered about the Southlands. With shaft and tip reunited, Ixil's Spike can now display its true potential.

Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts.

@2075 = ~Icingdeath +3~
@2076 = ~Frostbrand: 'Icingdeath'
It is one of Drizzt's personal weapons, specifically the one he usually holds in his right hand. Drizzt found Icingdeath in the treasure pile of Ingeloakastimizilian the white wyrm and this is where the weapon gets its name. The hilt of the scimitar is of black adamantite and the blade is made of silver with a diamond edge. The weapon absorbs fire and heat, protecting its wielder against fire, and this magical blade saved Drizzt's life every time he faced the demon Errtu.

Twinkle is Icingdeath's companion scimitar, held in his left hand (and worn on his right hip).

Twinkle has a star-cut sapphire on its pommel and when it detects danger nearby it softly glows blue.

@2079 = ~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerun.

Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers. In his loneliness, he spent many hours alone on the hills overlooking Trademeet. There Galloma, a wizard living in the area, discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul. The two fast became friends, and more: they were master and apprentice. Galloma died before Dramnek's apprenticeship could be completed, however, and the youth found himself once more alone in the world. Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla. There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma. Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced his weak body.

@2088 = ~Ilbratha +1~
@2089 = ~Mistress of Battle
This ancient bronze sword is set with six matching bloodstones, and gains its name from its illusionary powers, which are very useful in combat.
Ilbratha was created by unknown hands at the behest of Azoun the First, long dead king of Cormyr. He bore it once into battle, at Ithmong in his war with Tethyr, and then lost it in a storm that wrecked his ship on the rocks of The Neck. All trace of it was lost until, 200 winters later, the sage Thallastam of Procampur was offered the blade for 1,500 gold pieces by a peddler from a nearby town who seemed ignorant of its true nature. Thallastam brought the blade to Elminster in Shadowdale, the only loremaster with an interest in swords whom he trusted. Elminster identified the blade from the writings of Azoun I (the old king's great-grandson had just come to the throne), and Thallastam bore it back toward Procampur by way of Tilver's Gap and Essembra. But he was never seen again, and did not reach Procampur. His ruined diary, staff, and a skeleton were found some years later when the Pool of Yeven in Battledale was dragged, but the sword was never found.

@2090 = ~Arbane's Sword +2~
@2091 = ~Arbane's Sword of Agility
The first of these swords were created by the elf wizard, Lord Arbane of Myth Drannor many centuries ago. His first was stolen, so he made a second with the aid of an apprentice, who sold the secret to two other wizard-swordsmiths. The form of manufacture is thought to be forgotten now -Elminster has heard of no one making one in the last 500 years- but there are over a dozen in existence. Some have even been created with sentience and further powers.
One of many created in the name of the mage who first discovered how to enchant a blade in this manner, this was the weapon of the outlaw Garno, and many a cleric died at its edge. Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge. Despite his focussed hatred of the devout, it is thought that one of the gods of chaos had a hand in Garno's acquisition of this sword, delighting in the havoc that followed the young man.

However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.

Before Ilban, however, Belm was in the possession of a holy slayer from distant Zakhara. According to sages, the light sword was crafted to serve an order of assassins. Belm's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon. The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport. The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions. Ilban's exploits took Belm into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.

Beroalf was a barbarian who traveled from the cold north in search of adventure. He sought treasures and glory, but soon all he wanted were companions to share in the excitement of battle, much like those he had left behind in his faraway village. Unfortunately, his coarse remarks and rudimentary hygiene repelled most travelers he met, until he expressed his thoughts to a sympathetic mage. The mage, for a price, constructed Ras, the dancing blade. Though not quite what Beroalf had in mind, he was thrilled nonetheless, and wielded the sword for many years. How they were ultimately separated is not known.

@2105 = ~Adjatha the Drinker +2~
@2106 = ~The Drinker is first known to have existed more than 400 years ago, in the reign of Kurskos Ironhand; it was the sword of that monarch's herald and chief counselor, Amrok of the Dwarves. Kurskos slew Amrok in a night of revelry after a Shieldmeet, and took Adjatha the Drinker (and the enminity of the dwarves) as his own. Amrok was of almost human stature, and it has often been said Adjatha is of human and not dwarven manufacture, for it is of the full size and heft for a strong long-armed human swordsman.
The blade was stolen from the palace vaults in the sack of Aumreayum on the death of Kurskos, and since then The Drinker has changed hands often over the years, usually remaining with any one owner for only a short time. Elminster saw Adjatha 40 winters ago at the court of Nesker of Mulmaster, when the sorcerer-king was studying it to increase his own arts. It disappeared before Nesker's death and came to light briefly in reports of fighting in the Shaar, apparently being wielded by one of the nomad chieftains. The sword was stolen from him, and despite sending agents far afield, he was unable to recover it. Its whereabouts were unknown...but some suggested that the blade could have left the Prime Material Plane.

@2107 = ~Namarra +2~
@2108 = ~The Sword that Never Sleeps
On one side of the blade is etched in Common "Namarra", and on the other face "Never Sleep". Namarra appears in many legends and tall tales, but the designation the "Neversleep Sword" appears to be derived only from the inscription on the blade and does not refer to any specific property of the sword. Its origin is unknown; Namarra appears to have existed for long as tales have survived, wielded by such mythic heroes as Eth and Brensyl the Tall. Even the most critical of sages (Kurmur the Skeptic, First Speaker of Evernoster) cannot determine Namarra's probable time of origin or find any references in the tales of a word to a time "before Namarra was forged".
This ancient blade is thought to have been present at some of the most influential conflicts in Faerun's history. Sightings have been noted as far north as Thay and as far south as the jungles of Chult, though documentation is oddly lacking regarding the details. This is perhaps a result of the sword's ability to silence all sound within a large radius, removing the effectiveness of attacking mages, but also preventing any discussion that might have followed.

@2137 = ~Celestial Fury +3~
@2138 = ~Many years ago, fierce tempests and fires ignited by lightning ravished the province administered by daimyo Hoshi Katahiroi. The daimyo's advisers, all respected shukenjas, soon divined that Nature was not to blame, but a powerful dragon of an unknown order. Some of the wise men suggested that the creature was an abomination; others believed that it was born of Primal Chaos before Kara-Tur was formed. All the advisers agreed to name it Celestial Fury.
Yet daimyo Hoshi did not want to categorize the scourge of his province; he wanted to destroy it. He commissioned the famed Chigatta (a reclusive artisan, master of mystic arts), to construct a weapon that might sunder the dragon's spirit as well as cleave its scaled body. Chigatta's labors resulted in the finest katana imaginable, dubbed Celestial Fury after the beast it was fashioned to destroy, and enchanted with the power of flight.
With this weapon, Hoshi sought his province's bane among the storm clouds. Shouts and roars resounded through the heavens for days, and forked fire lit up the nights. At long last, Hoshi destroyed the dragon's body and trapped its spirit within his sword, merging the two Celestial Furies and impressing order over chaos. To finalize his victory, Hoshi had Chigatta fashion a scabbard from the dragon's hide and embed its magic pearl in the hilt.
Yet the dragon had its revenge. Hoshi was skilled in battle but weak of will. Celestial Fury's spirit took control of Hoshi, forcing him to slay Chigatta and then slay himself. The katana subsequently disappeared (most likely, Hoshi's grieving family discarded the traitorous weapon) and has perhaps changed many hands in the years since.

@2139 = ~Water's Edge +3~
@2140 = ~Due to their religious responsibilities, minions of Umberlee, are supposed to avoid personal entanglements with those who work the sea. Of course, even among those who follow dark gods, the pursuit of pleasure and emotional gratification often cause them to stray from their commandments. One priestess who strayed in such a fashion was Kalana Fisher. In 1357, she began a romance with the pirate captain Balhoderie. Though both were extremely flawed people with outrageous personalities and a complete lack of faithfulness, they had a strange mutual affection for each other. But while Balhoderie's great flaw was his mean temper, Kalana's was in holding grudges.
In 1366, Kalana tracked down the murderer of Balhoderie, a Talosian pirate captain named Madion. She planted information in Madion's spy network and anonymously offered him a tantalizing prize: three high-value merchant ships leaving the port of Baldur's Gate with few defenses. Low on money, Madion took the bait. He was slaughtered by the numerous guards that poured from the ships' holds.
As it had turned out, the merchant captain was a superstitious sort and had gone to the temple of Umberlee in Baldur's Gate for a divination. Without hesitation, the priestess Kalana had foretold a horrible attack outside the port. Not only did Kalana get her revenge, but the captain became a lifelong donator to the church of the Bitch Queen.
Nobody knows if Water's Edge, the blade Kalane had crafted for Balhoderie, was somehow retreived by the priestess herself or got lost in the ocean.

@2147 = ~Short Sword of Mask +4~
@2148 = ~Godsbane Legacy
This blade is highly prized by those who serve the Shadowlord, as well as any who engage in shadowy business.
Godsbane was the sword form assumed by Mask during the Time of Troubles. He would eventually come to be wielded by the then-mortal Cyric, who acquired the sword by murdering a halfling named Sneakabout, who in turn killed the former wielder of the sword.
Cyric named the sword "Godsbane" because while he was a mortal, he used it to slay Bhaal (then Lord of Murder), and after becoming a deity, he used it to kill Leira, Lady of Deception.
The soon-to-become Prince of Lies also used it to kill Kelemvor Lyonsbane while atop Blackstaff Tower, but to spite Cyric for trying to break his will while he was a mortal, Mask as Godsbane hid Kelemvor's soul from him. During a revolt in the City of Strife that marked the end of Cyric's reign as Lord of the Dead, Cyric learned of this and snapped the blade in two. This revealed the sword to be an aspect of Mask, the god of thievery and intrigue. By doing this, Cyric greatly weakened Mask and gained the portfolio of intrigue, along with shadowy characteristics. For this, Mask hates Cyric, and he continuously plots ways to recover his lost portfolio.
Whether this blade is one of the original sword's reproductions, or another of Mask's attempts to seek his revenge is beyond anyone's knowledge.

There are those who believe soul stealing capability has cursed the blade, for though fashioned as a weapon of right and justice, Foebane's dark history is one of murder and death.
Demron's own blood christened the blade, as a would be thief used the newly fashioned sword to bring about the Archmage's untimely death, though the thief did not survive the encounter, either. In the aftermath of Demron's murder, Foebane was recovered and presented to the hero Fflar to use in the defense of Myth Drannor, greatest of the Elven cities.
Yet even the power of Foebane was not enough to withstand the dark hordes which overran Myth Drannor. When the elven city fell, Captain Fflar met a grisly, gruesome end and the sword itself was lost beneath the rubble of the once great metropolis.

@2181 = ~It is no simple deed to enchant a katana. Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword. Improving it further usually requires a sacrifice; perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into his sword. The wielder of an enchanted katana such as this one must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried the blade into battle. Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. Thus, it is slightly slower, but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat. This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to augment the skill of the wielder.

The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, for their magic is dispelled with a word, and steadfastly resisted with ease.

She was a hated enemy of many a shaman whose magic often floundered against her berserker's fury. After a lifetime of raucous battle, it was old age that eventually claimed her.

@2205 = ~Lilarcor +3~
@2206 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance".
It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.
As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt", "Oh yeah! Got 'im good", and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter.
A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance and through mental discipline alone, the wielder must maintain the integrity of the blade. He can shape it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, sharpness of the edge and to a lesser extent, its magical properties.

Creatures within the area take 6d6 points of fire damage, those who successfully save vs. wands at -2 penalty take only half damage.
The second ability of the wand is akin to the wizard spell 'Agannazar's Scorcher' in that a column of flame will streak towards a victim, inflicting 5d6 points of fire damage to everyone in his path. The victim(s) may make a save vs. wands at -1 in order to reduce the damage dealt by half.

This flail was created a century ago to commemorate the defeat of the demon Belhifet. It was meant to remain within the town of Easthaven to remind the people of the great evil that had barely been defeated, but it was stolen, only to reappear years later on the northernmost reaches of the Sword Coast, in the City of Sails.

For a brief but bloody time, the fighting pits of Luskan were home to a particularly vicious halfling who called herself "Flurry." Though her opponents were swift to underestimate her, they were quickly surprised by the speed of her attacks and the effectiveness of her strikes. As her reputation grew, Flurry grew reckless, allowing her opponents one free hit on her small frame - showing off to the crowd that she seemed to be unharmed by the blow - before viciously bludgeoning her opponent to death. In the end, it was Flurry's own ego that did her in: in a match where her speed and cunning could have bested her adversary easily, the free hit she allowed him with his scythe proved to be more effective than she had planned, and send her head tumbling into the dust.

@2321 = ~A necklace is a piece of ornamental metal jewelry usually made of silver, gold, platinum, or other precious metals, and adorned with gems. A necklace is always worn on the neck and can be of any length.~
@2320 = ~Amulet of Health~
@2322 = ~When Jacin Maltis, a petty lord in Sembia, paid for the crafting of an amulet to increase his health, he expected a tasteful necklace with a small, but precious gem mounted in it. When he placed the necklace around his neck and the diamond turned a gaudy blood red, he refused to pay the wizard who created it. The wizard simply smiled, and loosed a spell that instantly destroyed the noble. Copies of this amulet were found circulating months later in the distant city of Waterdeep.

@2333 = ~Spider's Boots of Stealth~
@2334 = ~Spider's Legs
'Spider' was the nickname of an infamous half-elf thief who frequented the city of Athkatla. No one knew his real name, origin, or anything else about him, which was precisely the way the thief wanted it. Spider was a loner, never forming close relationships with the other Shadow Thief guild members.
There could be no doubt that he was one of the finest and most successful burglars in living memory, and his loyalty to the guild was never in question. Still, many in the guild considered him a malevolent menace. He was openly, undeniably evil. That fact, and his appearance and dress, led to rumors that he worshipped Lolth, the Spider Queen.
Spider was obsessed with his alias and nickname, and very flamboyant when on a caper. His face was tattooed with a web pattern, and much of his clothing was embroidered with similar motifs. His boots and cloak were known to be enchanted, and speculation was rife as to whether the items he supposedly found in his travels had subsequently shaped his personality and tastes. It was known that he had at least three additional pairs of the enchanted boots made so that one pair would always be clean.

@2336 = ~Boots of Lightning Speed
These modified boots of speed were originally intended to boost the wearer's speed rating even more so than would normal boots of speed. When used, the wearer's movement rate increases as if under the effect of normal boots of speed combined with a haste spell. Unfortunately, the wearer cannot attack, and the strain of rushing around so fast quickly tires even the most stalwart of heroes. Their nick-name is 'Heel of the Coward,' for that summarizes their most obvious use: running away.

Once worn, they come as a significant help in battle granting an almost unsustainable speed to attacks, and will definitely remind the wearer of the long enduring gratitude of its creators. Some of these generous drows find it amusing to then conjure a horde of small mutated spiders...

As a member of a Shadow Thieves' guild, a shadow thief of Amn knows only their own minions, their coworkers, and their superior.

The blade is indeed vampiric, as the name would suggest; but not only in the manner the finder might have hoped. This semi-sentient blade performs as one might think a vampiric blade would, but it was crafted by vampires for their exclusive use, and any living being wielding it will slowly bleed to death in order to feed its unending thirst for blood.

This blade is perfect for the warrior concerned about defense as well as offense but it is so sharp and light that it is difficult for even a master to wield. Viromoto gradually became overconfident and for his final duel he favored a different weapon -- only to fall in battle, his first and only defeat.
